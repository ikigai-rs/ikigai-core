//! The representation cache: what the kernel keeps, how long it stays valid, and
//! what it is willing to forget.
//!
//! Three concerns live here, and keeping them apart is the whole design:
//!
//! 1. **Validity** — golden-thread edges ([`Thread`] generations) and the time
//!    deadline on [`Expiry::At`]. This decides whether an entry is *correct* to
//!    serve, and nothing else in this module may override it.
//! 2. **Admission and eviction** — [`CachePolicy`]. This decides whether an entry is
//!    *worth keeping*. A policy can never make the kernel serve something stale: it
//!    is consulted only on the way in and on the way out, never on the way back.
//! 3. **Bounds** — [`CacheBound`]. Before this module the cache was two bare
//!    `HashMap`s with no eviction anywhere: entries left only when a lookup happened
//!    to find them invalid, so a long-lived process driven by ungated cacheable
//!    operations grew without limit. Both maps are bounded now.
//!
//! # The lost-cut race
//!
//! A cache entry pins each of its golden threads to the generation that thread held
//! *when the entry was stored*. Reading those generations after the invocation
//! returns is wrong, and silently so:
//!
//! - t0 — a read begins; the endpoint observes state S.
//! - t1 — a `Sink` cuts thread T, bumping its generation 5 → 6.
//! - t2 — the read returns a representation built from S, which is now stale.
//! - t3 — the store pins T at **6**, and the stale representation is filed as valid
//!   against the very cut that should have invalidated it.
//!
//! The entry then stays "fresh" until some future, unrelated cut. [`ReprCache`]
//! closes this with a **cut sequence**: every cut takes the next number from one
//! monotonic counter and is recorded in a bounded log. A request takes a
//! [`CutSnapshot`] before it invokes anything, and [`ReprCache::store`] declines the
//! entry if any thread it depends on was cut after that snapshot. Declining is
//! always safe — not caching is never wrong — so this never tries to reconcile.
//!
//! Two properties of that choice are worth stating, because both were deliberate:
//!
//! - It is **per-thread, not global**. A global "did anything get cut?" check would
//!   be simpler and far more destructive: a one-second graph build on a busy host
//!   would decline to cache because some unrelated resource was written during it,
//!   turning a correctness fix into the kind of ~2000× read regression that
//!   propagation bugs cause. Only a cut to a thread *this result depends on*
//!   declines the store.
//! - It is **conservative when it cannot tell**. The cut log is bounded
//!   ([`CUT_LOG`]); if a snapshot is older than the oldest cut still retained, cuts
//!   in between may have been forgotten, and the store is declined rather than
//!   guessed at.
