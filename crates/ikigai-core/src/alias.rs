//! **Logical rewrite** — a stable logical URI that resolves to a different backing
//! resource, without the caller knowing.
//!
//! `urn:log:config` → `file:/logConfig.yaml` (an *exact* alias: one name, one
//! backing thing). `urn:fn:` → `urn:iki:fn:` (a *prefix* alias: a whole namespace
//! moves, and every name under it follows). Same mechanism; exact is the
//! degenerate prefix.
//!
//! ## Why it exists
//!
//! An audit found 98 unregistered `urn:` namespace identifiers across the
//! ecosystem, with an IANA-registered one (`urn:isbn:`) already arriving in the
//! same graph from Zotero. Consolidating under a single `urn:iki:` namespace
//! without this primitive is a flag day: nine repos, seventeen published crates,
//! two live machines and a deployed browser demo all changing identity at once.
//! With it, old names keep resolving through a transition window and each repo
//! moves at its own pace.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! [`Alias`] is a `Space` decorator in the **interception-overlay family** — the
//! same shape as `ikigai-throttle`'s `RateLimit`/`Timeout`: wrap a space, add a
//! cross-cutting behaviour to every resolution flowing through it, leave the
//! wrapped space unaware. It is deliberately *not* a second composition
//! mechanism.
//!
//! Hosts that resolve against a bare `Space` wrap it directly. Hosts running a
//! [`Kernel`](crate::Kernel) install the table with
//! [`Kernel::with_aliases`](crate::Kernel::with_aliases), which both wraps the
//! root **and** teaches the kernel the table — the kernel wants it in its own
//! hands for the readout at `urn:kernel:aliases`, for refusing a cyclic table
//! before dispatch, and for attributing a miss to the rule that moved the name.
//!
//! It is no longer needed for *identity*. This overlay reports every rewrite it
//! performs on [`Resolved::canonical`](crate::Resolved::canonical), and the kernel
//! adopts the reported name before it computes the cache key or fires the
//! golden-thread cut. So an `Alias` composed by hand under another overlay —
//! `RateLimit::new(Alias::new(table, space))` — shares one cache entry and one
//! thread across both names, which it did not before 0.1.64.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use ikigai_core::{AliasTable, Iri};
//!
//! let table = AliasTable::new().prefix("urn:fn:", "urn:iki:fn:");
//! let hop = table.canonicalize(&Iri::parse("urn:fn:toUpper").unwrap());
//! assert_eq!(hop.canonical().unwrap().as_str(), "urn:iki:fn:toUpper");
//! # let _ = Arc::new(table);
//! ```
//!
//! ## ★ The five decisions, and why
//!
//! A rewrite primitive goes wrong in five specific places. None of them is
//! answerable by "whatever falls out of the implementation", so each is forced
//! here and enforced by a test.
//!
//! **1. Rewrite happens BEFORE the capability check.** Authority is *also* named
//! by URN (`urn:cap:fs:read:…`), so the ordering is a security decision, not a
//! plumbing one. The kernel canonicalizes the target first and evaluates the
//! declared-capability floor against the **backing** resource — the thing that
//! will actually be touched. The other order is an escalation device: check
//! `urn:public:thing`, then rewrite to `urn:secret:thing`, and the grant that was
//! examined is not the grant that was needed. A *silent grant* is strictly worse
//! than a silent denial, so the order is fixed in the safe direction.
//!
//! The cost of that choice is the failure the ecosystem has already paid for
//! twice this month: a caller holding a grant that names the **pre-alias** scope
//! now fails a check against the post-alias target, by simply not holding it,
//! with nothing in any log. So this module refuses to let that be silent — see
//! *Observability* below. Note what is deliberately **not** done: the table is
//! never applied to capability scopes. Rewriting authority to follow a name is
//! how you manufacture the silent grant; migrating grants is an explicit act by
//! whoever mints them.
//!
//! **2. `Meta` reports the BACKING name.** Self-description that lies breaks the
//! catalog, selection and the MCP projection downstream. The canonical target is
//! adopted before dispatch, so the description an endpoint returns — and the
//! `Description::id` the catalog and `urn:kernel:actions` key on — is the
//! backing one, everywhere, with no special case. The alias is disclosed as
//! *provenance* (a trace note), never by editing the description.
//!
//! **3. The two names SHARE a cache entry and a golden thread.** They must: a
//! `Sink` through one name that left the other serving a stale representation is
//! the invalidation bug that is hardest to see, because both answers look
//! plausible. The representation cache keys on [`Request::id`](crate::Request::id)
//! and the auto-cut on `request.target`, so identity is settled at one point on
//! the resolution path — for the cache key, the auto-cut, the trace event and the
//! `Invocation` the endpoint sees alike.
//!
//! It is settled by the **resolver reporting what it rewrote**, not by the kernel
//! knowing the table in advance. This overlay stamps
//! [`Resolved::canonical`](crate::Resolved::canonical); the kernel adopts it
//! before the id is computed. The earlier design — canonicalize at the top from a
//! table the kernel holds — is still there (it is what refuses a cycle *before*
//! dispatch and what attributes a miss), but it was the *only* mechanism, and it
//! only ever fired for a table installed through
//! [`Kernel::with_aliases`](crate::Kernel::with_aliases). Composed by hand under
//! another overlay, the rewrite happened and the canonicalization did not: two
//! cache entries and two golden threads over one resource, with
//! `(no rewrite table installed)` in a readout nobody reads as the only signal.
//! Reporting closes that, because the report travels with the resolution however
//! the space was assembled.
//!
//! **4. The catalog lists the BACKING name, once.** [`Alias::entries`] is
//! transparent — it forwards the wrapped space's entries unchanged. Listing both
//! names over-offers: two IRIs for one resource, an agent picking arbitrarily,
//! and selection dedup (which keys on description id) quietly collapsing them
//! anyway. Listing the alias *instead* would hide the name the system is moving
//! to. The migration property this buys is the one that matters: during the
//! transition the catalog advertises only the **new** names, so every consumer
//! that discovers resources by reading the catalog migrates forward on its own,
//! while every consumer still holding an old name keeps working. Aliases are not
//! hidden — they are a resource of their own, at `urn:kernel:aliases`.
//!
//! **5. Chains resolve; cycles are refused, loudly.** `A→B→C` is followed
//! transitively up to [`AliasTable::max_hops`] (default
//! [`DEFAULT_MAX_HOPS`]) — a namespace migration layered on an earlier one is a
//! real shape, and refusing it would force operators to pre-compose their tables
//! by hand. `A→B, B→A` is detected by a visited set and **refused** with an error
//! naming the trail; it is never silently truncated to a partial rewrite, which
//! would resolve to whichever name the loop happened to stop on. Over-long and
//! malformed rewrites take the same refusal path, for the same reason: a
//! half-applied rewrite is a wrong answer that looks like a right one.
//!
//! ## Observability
//!
//! A rewrite the operator cannot see is a bad afternoon waiting to happen
//! ("it resolves under the old name but not the new one"). Three channels, in
//! increasing order of how much has to be switched on:
//!
//! - **Always on** — per-rule counters (`hops`, `unresolved`, `refused`),
//!   readable at `urn:kernel:aliases` beside the rules themselves. A rule that
//!   fired and then missed says exactly that, with no tracer installed.
//! - **When a tracer is installed** — every [`TraceEvent`](crate::TraceEvent) for
//!   an aliased request carries a note under
//!   [`ALIAS_NOTE`](crate::ALIAS_NOTE) reading `logical -> canonical`, including
//!   the denial event (which names something that never ran) and the miss.
//! - **In the error text** — a capability denial on an aliased target names the
//!   hop, and adds an explicit hint when the caller's capability holds a scope
//!   mentioning the pre-alias prefix. That is the exact silent-failure shape from
//!   decision 1, turned into a sentence.
