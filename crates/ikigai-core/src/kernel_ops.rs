//! The kernel's own operations, as self-describing resources.
//!
//! `urn:kernel:*` is resolved *intrinsically* — [`Kernel::issue`](crate::Kernel::issue)
//! intercepts the prefix before the root space, which therefore never binds those
//! names. That is correct for dispatch and was wrong for **description**: the root
//! space is what every `entries → Meta → describe` walk enumerates, so the catalog,
//! the action manifold, describe-by-id and `urn:kernel:validate` all listed every
//! endpoint in the system except the kernel's own. The resources that make everything
//! else legible were the ones the system could not describe — `ikigai -c list`
//! returned 266 bindings and not one `urn:kernel:`.
//!
//! This module closes that by giving each operation a real [`Description`] and
//! wrapping them in a [`Space`] the kernel composes IN FRONT OF its root **for
//! description only** ([`Kernel::described`](crate::Kernel)). Dispatch is untouched:
//! `urn:kernel:*` still never reaches a space on the issue path, and [`KernelOp`]
//! refuses invocation precisely so that a future refactor which *did* route through
//! here would fail loudly instead of silently answering nothing.
//!
//! ## Declared = enforced, mechanically
//!
//! Each description's `requires` is the same scope its arm in
//! [`Kernel::issue_kernel`](crate::Kernel) passes to `require_cap`, and the kernel
//! gates on the declaration itself before dispatching, so a declaration cannot
//! over-offer. The converse — an arm enforcing a scope nobody declared — is what
//! `kernel_ops_declare_exactly_what_they_enforce` in `kernel.rs` pins.
//!
//! [`Verb::Meta`] is deliberately absent from every `requires`: `action_specs()`
//! filters Meta out (it is universal, never a selectable action), so describing a
//! kernel operation is ungated exactly as `describe urn:kernel:actions` has always
//! been. Reading a description discloses nothing the crate documentation does not.
